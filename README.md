✅️: Working

⛓️‍💥 : Issues when linking libraries

## Usage

``` rust no_run
use diffusion_rs::{api::txt2img, preset::{Preset,PresetBuilder}};
let config = PresetBuilder::default()
            .preset(Preset::SDXLTurbo1_0Fp16)
            .prompt("a lovely duck drinking water from a bottle")
            .build()
            .unwrap();
txt2img(config).unwrap();
```

## Troubleshooting

* Something other than Windows/Linux isn't working!
  * I don't have a way to test these platforms, so I can't really help you.
* I get a panic during binding generation build!
  * You can attempt to fix it yourself, or you can set the `DIFFUSION_SKIP_BINDINGS` environment variable.
      This skips attempting to build the bindings whatsoever and copies the existing ones. They may be out of date,
      but it's better than nothing.
    * `DIFFUSION_SKIP_BINDINGS=1 cargo build`
  * If you can fix the issue, please open a PR!

## Roadmap

1. ~~Ensure that the underline cpp library compiles on supported platforms~~
2. ~~Build an easy to use library with model presets~~
3. ~~Automatic library publishing on crates.io by gh actions~~
4. _Maybe_ prebuilt CLI app binaries
